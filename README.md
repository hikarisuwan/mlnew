# ML Analysis Project

Code for analyzing two datasets using common classifiers (Random forest, KNN etc).

### Setup

You need Python installed. The scripts use these libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install them with:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn 

How to Run:
There are two separate scripts, one for each dataset. Run them from the main project folder so the imports work correctly.

Dataset 1: python dataset1/dataset_1_code.py
Results go to dataset1/outputs_ds2/

Dataset 2:python dataset2/dataset_2_code.py
Results go to dataset2/outputs_ds2/

File Structure
ml_classes.py: Main logic for cleaning, training and plotting

dataset1/ & dataset2/: Folders containing the raw CSVs and the runner scripts
